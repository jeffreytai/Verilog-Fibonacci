# Verilog-Fibonacci
Produce fibonacci sequence with Verilog on Nexys 3 Spartan-6 FPGA board

Uses registers for push, multiply, add, and send operators<br/>
Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter on FPGA board reads in instructions from file and executes them sequentially.<br/>
<br/>
fib.code creates chain of instructions to generate Fibonacci sequence
